\section{What will I learn on this module?}

\noindent The lectures covering the theoretical/standards components of network services and functionality and how they map to a business infrastructure within different operating systems.\\

\noindent The Seminars will cover the current operating systems support for these protocols and services and allow the student to implement these services/facilities and apply them to business needs with a theoretical underpinning.\\

\noindent This module aims to provide an experience in the practical use and application of an operating system in a network environment to provide the essential services required for a commercial organisation.\\

\noindent This module will allow you to develop skills in the configuration of an operating systems in a networked environment.\\

\noindent The module provides an opportunity for you to develop an appreciation of services and the practical skills required for developing and deploying network services into a corporate infrastructure.\\



\section{How will I learn on this module?}

\noindent The module will be taught as a combination of lectures and seminars.\\

\noindent The lectures covering the theoretical/standards components of network services and functionality and how they map to a business.\\

\noindent The Seminars will cover the current operating systems support for these protocols and services and allow the student to implement these services/facilities and apply them to business needs with a theoretical underpinning.\\



\section{How will I be supported academically on this module?}

\noindent You will be supported by laboratory supervision and by being direction to suitable white papers and textbooks.\\

\section{What will I be expected to read on this module?}

\noindent All modules at Northumbria include a range of reading materials that students are expected to engage with. The reading list for this module can be found at: http://readinglists.northumbria.ac.uk
(Reading List service online guide for academic staff this containing contact details for the Reading List team - http://library.northumbria.ac.uk/readinglists)\\

\section{What will I be expected to achieve?}

\noindent \textbf{Knowledge \& Understanding:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Select appropriate features of an operating system for computer network implementation.
\end{itemize}
~\\
\noindent \textbf{Intellectual / Professional skills \& abilities:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Justify the integration of network services at the intranet and internet level for a commercial organisation.
  \item Configure networking functions such as, web servers, DNS, file sharing and databases.  
\end{itemize}
~
\\\noindent \textbf{Personal Values Attributes (Global / Cultural awareness, Ethics, Curiosity) (PVA):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Appreciate the impact of network services for both local and global implementations.
\end{itemize}

\section{How will I be assessed?}

\noindent Summative assessment will be and examination covering the configuration of the technologies to show an understanding of current trends in technology implementations.\\

\noindent The configuration component will be drawn from practical work that they must complete in the lab. (The assessment will cover all MLO's)\\

\section{Module abstract}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Students will be expected to research current publications on network protocols and network services
  \item Students will be taught specific aspects of network operating system.
  \item Directed learning will direct students towards specific standards (ietf standards RFC's) and texts.
  \item The students will be required to produce a technical report that is specifically focused towards the subject area.
  \end{itemize}
